Download Link to [Latest Build](https://github.com/JAhimaz/KnapsackProblemSimulation/releases/download/1.0.0/Knapsack.Problem.-.CSC2103.zip)

In order to run the program:
1. If MACOSX, open the MacOSX.app file.
2. If Windows, run the shortcut
3. If the shortcut does not work, click into the "Windows Version" folder and run "Knapsack Problem - CSC2103.exe"
4. Further instructions of the program can be found on the report, or by clicking on "Information - For Lecturer" when inside the application.

If required, the code can be found within the "Code" folder, but it is not runnable as it is in C# and Unity3D, this is for viewing the algorithm.

The Algorithm can be found in Solve.cs under the method "SolveKnapsackProblem()"
